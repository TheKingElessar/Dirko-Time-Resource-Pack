This is the resource pack that I use. It has:
 - Low fire (made by me).
 - Variation texture (so all the stone doesn't look the same). Most of these textures are from [Vader's Alternative Block Pack - Vanilla Add-On](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/vaders-alternative-block-pack-vanilla-add-on), but I made some myself.
 - Pieces of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/), including quieter sounds, better water, and some alternate textures.
 - Probably some random texture/model errors but whatever

To download, click `Code` --> `Download ZIP`. Extract the ZIP into a folder. That folder should contain a folder by the exact same name. **Cut/move (not copy)** the inner folder into the directory that the outer folder is in. Then, you can move the full `Dirko-Time-Resource-Pack-master.zip` folder into your `resourcepacks` folder in your `.minecraft` directory!
