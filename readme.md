This is the resource pack that I use. It has:
 - Low fire (made by me).
 - Variation texture (so all the stone doesn't look the same). Most of these textures are from [Vader's Alternative Block Pack - Vanilla Add-On](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/vaders-alternative-block-pack-vanilla-add-on), but I made some myself.
 - Pieces of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/), including quieter sounds, better water, and some alternate textures.
